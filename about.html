      <h3>BIO</h3>
      <p>A driven and versatile conductor, Ryan Tani has been praised for his compelling musicianship in a wide range of
        symphonic and choral repertoire. Ryan currently serves as the Orchestral Conducting Fellow for the Yale
        Philharmonia, under Music Director Peter Oundjian. He also serves as the Music Director of the Occasional
        Symphony in Baltimore. In 2015, he was declared the winner of the ACDA Undergraduate Student Conducting
        Competition at their national conference in Salt Lake City, Utah. </p>
      <p>An advocate of new and early music, Ryan has stayed active as conductor and performer for new compositions by
        emerging composers. He is resident conductor of the New Music New Haven series, where he collaborates, under
        guidance of Aaron Jay Kernis, with Yale University composition students and faculty. During his time at Peabody,
        he regularly worked to record and perform new works for orchestral, chamber, and choral ensembles. With the
        Concerto Chamber Orchestra in Los Angeles, he programmed exciting concerts to showcase composers of all levels.
        He also performed as a tenor with Thornton Edge, a contemporary music ensemble at the University of Southern
        California and was in demand several times per year as a conductor for student composition recitals. </p>

      <p> Ryan served as Assistant Conductor of the Chesapeake Youth Symphony Orchestra, where he was the principal
        conductor of the Preparatory Orchestra. He also served as Conducting Fellow for the Montgomery Philharmonic.</p>
      <p> During his tenure as Co-Founder and Music Director of the Concerto Chamber Orchestra from 2012-2015, Ryan
        helped positively shape the orchestral scene in the Los Angeles area by providing a medium for high-level
        performance opportunities to student musicians of all majors. The infrastructure that he and his Board put
        together thrives to this day. </p>
      <p> Prior to his conducting study, Ryan worked actively as a tenor in the Los Angeles area. He was in demand as a
        soloist in several professional early-music and new-music groups, including the USC Thornton Baroque Sinfonia,
        Horizon Music Group, Tesserae LA, De Angelis, Flos Campi and Thornton Edge, among others. He was also a member
        of the USC Chamber Singers, which recently received the 2015 American Prize in Choral Music.</p>
      <p> Ryan is a graduate of the Peabody Institute where he studied conducting with Marin Alsop and Markand Thakar,
        and of the University of Southern California, where he studied voice with Gary Glaze. In addition to his studies
        at Peabody, Ryan has also studied conducting with Grant Cooper, Jos√©-Luis Novo, Larry Rachleff, Donald
        Schleicher, and Gerard Schwarz. Ryan remains an active tenor in New Haven, and plays violin, jazz piano, and
        computer programming for enjoyment. </p>
